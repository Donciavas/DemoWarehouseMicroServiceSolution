# Simple Demo WarehouseMicroServiceSolution

This solution is a collection of three microservices with different database (SQL Server, MySQL & MongoDB). It is developed with API Gateway which communicates with all the three microservices for doing the CRUD operations. Finally, a Web Application is added which only communicates with the API Gateway.
