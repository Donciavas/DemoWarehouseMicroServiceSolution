# WarehouseMicroServiceSolution

This solution is a collection of three microservices with different database (SQL Server, MySQL & MongoDB). I'll be developing a API Gateway which communicates with all the three microservices for doing the CRUD operations. Finally, will also develop a Web Application which only communicates with the API Gateway.
